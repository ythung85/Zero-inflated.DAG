title: "ZiGDAG: R package for model-based causal discovery for zero-inflated count data (python version)"

Reference: [ZiGDAG: R package for model-based causal discovery for zero-inflated count data](https://github.com/junsoukchoi/ZiGDAG/tree/master).
The `ZiGDAG` from choi is written in `R` and `C++`, and the hill-climbing algorithm here is written in `Python`. However, the processing speed is relatively slow while doing simulation.
